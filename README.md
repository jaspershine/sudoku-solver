# sudoku-solver
text based sudoku solver written by Jasper Shine

The user can either use the solver on one of nine preset boards or the user can enter a valid, solvable board to be solved.
Uses a recursive based approach with backtracking when a point is reached where there are no more valid values at a certain position.

# To run the sudoku solver:
python sudoku_solver.py
